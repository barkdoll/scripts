# Scripts for automating the daily monotony

## [Read a blog post about my automation revelation here](https://theguyjin.com/scripting-to-automate-tasks/)

As a self-proclaimed perfectionist whose attention to detail can sometimes stall my productivity _(read **OCD**)_, I found myself wanting to speed up a lot of the repetitive tedious tasks I was accumulating.

I have taken a series of small JavaScript hiatuses over my dev journey to branch off of my usual grind and learn something new. 

One of those things was **bash**.
Another one of those things was **python**.

Then I realized that scripting in these two languages was useful for system automation.

## And I was like OH YES.

This repo is just a list of scripts I have written to automate various productivity and data processing tasks. You can use them for reference or adapt them for your own automation needs. Also feel free to ask me questions about them if you are learning to script too.
